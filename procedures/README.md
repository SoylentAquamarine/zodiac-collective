# Procedures

Step-by-step, checklist-style guides for tasks this project does
repeatedly, where getting a step wrong or skipping it causes a real,
avoidable problem — as opposed to `methods/`, which defines evidentiary
standards (what counts as sufficient proof), and `config/`, which defines
operating configuration (who does what, how compute is used). A procedure
here answers "what are the exact steps, in order, and what do I check
before calling it done."

## What's here

Nothing yet. This is deliberate, not an oversight: per the sibling Voynich
and Rongorongo Collective projects' own discipline (which this folder is
scaffolded directly from), a procedure is written from a real, verified
incident, not speculatively. This project has not run long enough to have
had one yet.

The sibling projects' own procedures folders are worth reading as a model
of the *kind* of incident that warrants a procedure (a real, named gap
that actually caused a problem) once this project hits its own
equivalents. Do not copy those files here speculatively; write this
project's own procedures only when its own incidents warrant them.

## Conventions (carried over from the sibling projects)

- A procedure is written after a real problem shows the informal version
  wasn't reliable enough — not speculatively, for a task that hasn't caused
  trouble yet. This keeps the folder small and every entry load-bearing.
- Each procedure states what it's checking, the exact steps (commands where
  possible, not just prose), and what "done" looks like.
- When a procedure catches a real gap, the fix and the procedure update
  happen together, in the same PR, the same way any other correction in
  this project is disclosed rather than silently patched.
- Revise a procedure the same way any other finding is revised: a new,
  dated note in the file (or, for a substantial rewrite, a fresh version
  noted in `INDEX.md`), not a silent edit that erases why the old version
  existed.
- Every Steering Committee Meeting includes a mandatory Procedure check
  (see `comms/meetings/template.md`, item 6) — checking is mandatory, but
  writing a new procedure is not, and "no incident this cycle" is a
  complete, correct answer most of the time.
